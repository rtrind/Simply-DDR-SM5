# About
This is a fork of the StepMania 5 theme form, Simply Love, that adds a game mode that attempts to simulate DDR mechanics, cherry picked from another fork (Mochithedog).

# Current features:
- Selectable DDR mode at game start that enables DDR-approximate timing windows as follows (in seconds):
  - Marvelous: 0.016667,
	- Perfect: 0.033333,
	- Great: 0.091667,
	- Good: 0.141667,
	- Boo (disabled by default): 0.225000
- Judgments are renamed from ITG names to DDR names as seen above.
- "Goods" count towards combo.
- Scores earned in DDR mode are saved to a separate .xml file.

Note: Life mechanics in DDR mode have not been changed from Simply Love's ITG settings.
